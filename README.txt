## Dark and Darker (DaD) â€“ Project Wiki

This project is a wiki for my custom board game originally called **Dark and Darker** (the name may be changed in the future, as a game with that title already exists).

You can browse the cards that will appear in the game. By clicking on a type name (e.g. Attacks, Enemies, etc.), you can fold and unfold the card lists.

It's a JavaScript-heavy project, still in development. I'm currently working on a **fighting simulator** that handles combat against monsters.
